            <h2 id="Agenda"><b>Agenda Plan</b></h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                <em>This plan builds on the understanding of loops from previous lessons and gives students a chance to be truly creative. This activity doubles as a debugging exercise for extra problem-solving practice.</em>
            </p>
            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>This plan highlights the power of loops with an array of puzzles meant to get students thinking about why repeat loops are superior to longhand.</strong>
            </p>
            <h3>Teaching Guide</h3>
            <p>
                Students should have had an introduction to loops at this point. Based on what you think your class could benefit from, we recommend:
                <ul>
                    <li>Creating a new dance with loops just like in <b>"Getting Loopy"</b></li>
                    <li>Reviewing a puzzle from the last lesson</li>
                    <li>Previewing a puzzle from this lesson</li>
                </ul>
                Any of these should help prepare your class for fun with the online puzzles!
            </p>
            <p>
                Some students may discover where to add repeat loops by writing out the program without loops then circling sections of repetitions. If the students in your class seem like they could benefit from this, have them keep paper and pencils beside them at their machines. Students might also enjoy drawing some of the shapes and figures on paper as they program online.
            </p>
            <p>
               <b><i>Journaling:</i></b> Having students write about what they learned, why it's useful, and how they feel about it can help solidify any knowledge they obtained today and build a review sheet for them to look to in the future.<br>
                <strong><i>Journal Prompts:</i></strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>What was today's lesson about?</li>
                    <li>How did you feel during today's lesson?</li>
                    <li>What was the coolest shape or figure you programmed today? Draw it out!</li>
                    <li>What is another shape or figure you could program using loop? Can you come up with the code to create it?</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
             <h3>Observing and Monitoring Interactions</h3>
            <p>We all want to help ALL our students.  We don't want anyone feeling left out, like they don't belong, like they can't do it, or like their questions aren't being answered.  But, especially as you are beginning to teach computing, it can be hard to manage helping students and making the observations and reflections to ensure all students are getting what they need.</p>
            <p>We should create a template that we can use each day you have a lab time.</p>

            <li>For younger students, simple looping activities such as creating patterns using shapes or colors can be introduced. As they progress, they can be taught more complex loops such as the while loop and the for loop.</li>
            <li>Teaching looping can also be made more engaging and interactive by using visual programming languages such as Scratch or Blockly, which allow students to drag and drop blocks of code to create loops and other programming constructs.</li>
            <li>Overall, looping is an important concept in computer programming that can be introduced to K12 students in a fun and interactive way, and can help develop their problem-solving and critical thinking skills.</li>

                As a teacher you need many examples of where we see things <b>"repeated"</b> or <b>"looped"</b> in the real world.<br>
                Share an idea below of a real world example of things that repeat.
